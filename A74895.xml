         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>My dear hearts, you whom the Lord hath manife≈øted ≈øo much love unto, as to call you out of ≈øin and death, and the world, all the delights and plea≈øures of the world, which fades away, up to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, where is joy un≈øpeakable, plea≈øures and riches that endure for evermore, Dear friends, watch and be ≈øober, that you may hear the voice of your beloved when he calleth, and let not the precious proffers of the love of God be tendred in vain; while you have an ear open to the world, you cannot hear the voice of God, ≈øo that you have bin made to groan under it: how long have you been deceived by it all your time, promi≈øing peace, fulne≈øs, and ≈øatisfaction, but have bin brought to cry out of oppre≈ø≈øion and deceit, and your cries are come before the Lord of Sabbaths, who is your re≈øt, and he is now appeared to deliver you, and ≈øet you free from bondage, that you may ≈øerve him alone. And now take heed of con≈øulting with your old ma≈øter; hath the Lord been ≈øo mercifull unto you, as that he hath ≈øet your faces out of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> towards the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed land, O take heed of looking back, left you be taken captive, and led back again, and ≈øo you come ≈øhort of redemption, and your faith fail you, and ≈øo you come ≈øhort of the promi≈øe, for unbelief cannot enter into the re≈øt; but you, Dear friends, put on re≈øolution, put on ≈øtrength, be valiant for your freedome, ca≈øt off every weight, follow your Captain the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who for the joy ≈øet before him, indured the cro≈øs, de≈øpi≈øed the ≈øhame, and ≈øo entred into re≈øt and glory. Take heed of halting between God and the World; what agreement can there be or what peace, while you are married to the world? Your thoughts turn in thither, and you are adulterated from God, who gives you all good things, as ≈øo many tokens of his love; hereby is the broken language brought forth, and you cannot ≈øpeak the pure language of the land of re≈øt. And while you give way to that in you, which leads you to look back to what is behind you; you keep your ≈øelves in the wilderne≈øs and darkne≈øs, and lo≈øe your way, and know not where you are, grieving the holy Spirit of the Lord which hath appeared unto you to guide you to but (O friends!) mind your guide, and follow him; Ari≈øe, ≈øhine, your light is come, and the glory of the Lord is come upon you, the night is far ≈øpent, the day is at hand, even the day of Sions deliverance; Ari≈øe, come away all you that love her, come off from the World and worldly things, come into the life, lie no longer in death and dead things. Awake thou that ≈øleepe≈øt, and ≈øtand up from the dead, that Chri≈øt may give thee light: Come forth, come forth of all created things, witne≈øs your redemption to all the world, that you are redeemed from the earth upto God, out of all kindreds, tongues, people, and nations, to reign as Kings and Prie≈øts for ever, above the world, ≈øin and death. triumphing and treading upon all that would take you captive: This is the day of your deliverance, own it with the lo≈øs of all fading plea≈øures, make it appear to all the world, this is the day you waited for, even the day of your joy, but of the worlds ≈øorrow: A day of blackne≈øs and gloomine≈øs, a day of fear and trouble to them that oppre≈øs you; a day wherein the Kingdome of Je≈øus Chri≈øt ≈øhall be

O my dear hearts, my de≈øire to God for you all is, that you might come to ≈øee what un≈øpeakable riches is laid up for you in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, which is hid from all fle≈øh, neither can you ≈øee it while you live in the fle≈øh; and while you continue your love to the world and worldly things, you keep out the manife≈øtation of the Fathers love, for your hearts canot receive both, Now ≈øhew your ≈øelves wi≈øe men, choo≈øe that which is eternal, here is light and life tendred you in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, freely out of the Fathers love, freely receive life and love, and ≈øhew forth life and love to God again, by giving up to him all you have and all you are for Chri≈øts ≈øake, that ≈øo you may come to receive all again with Chri≈øt, who is the fulne≈øs of the Fathers love, and in him are all good things needfull for this life, and that which is to come, even the earne≈øt of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance which none can take from you, which once being received, you ≈øhall never hunger more, having a wel ≈øpring within even the witne≈øs of eternal life and love; and as Chri≈øt appears, who is our life and love, ≈øo ≈øhall life and love appear, ≈øpring, blo≈ø≈øom, and bring forth fruit towards God and man; that ≈øo being rai≈øed with him from death and dead works, you may henceforth live unto God, and being brought into onene≈øs with him, and purity, and holine≈øs, you may be one amongst your ≈øelves, of one heart and one minde, ≈øpeaking one and the ≈øelf ≈øame thing, and having the ≈øame care one for another, as for your ≈øelves. And take heed that there be not in any of you a principle of ≈øelf-love, which once having, will lead to ≈øeparation and divi≈øion, ca≈øting a ≈øtumbling block in the way of the ≈øimple; and ≈øo they that are weak being defiled and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back into the world. And I be≈øeech you brethren that you mark them that once ≈øet their faces towards Sion, but not being willing to deny the world, and take up the Cro≈øs, have con≈øulted with fle≈øh and blood, and turned back into <hi>Egypt</hi> again, of ≈øuch take heed, knowing that the ≈øame ≈øpirit that hath wrought in them deceitfully, will not cea≈øe to work by them to deceive others to maintain its own Kingdom; but you ≈øtanding fa≈øt in the pure light of Chri≈øt, you ≈øhall ≈øee whither the≈øe return, and the cau≈øe of their returnings, and that the end of ≈øuch is wor≈øe then the beginning; but there mu≈øt be ≈øuch, that they who are approved may be made manife≈øt. But you my Brethren, be ye ≈øo far from following ≈øuch, that their falling away may cau≈øe you to watch and ≈øearch by what power you ≈øtand, and ≈øo a pure fear may be pre≈øerved in you, by which you may be kept in the way that leads to the Crown which is immortall: for it is he that overcomes that mu≈øt wear the Crown, wherefore faint not, nor think any thing hard, the Lord cals unto you, nothing mu≈øt ≈øuffer but that which is to die, that your ≈øouls may live: O your light affliction worketh for you a far more exceeding weight of glory, while you keep your eye to that which is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible; wherefore give up your ≈øelves to his will in all things, Stand in the will
